# 🚗 Vehicle Checkpoint System - My First Kotlin Project

**Date:** February 2026  
**Skill Level:** Beginner  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## 📋 Description
A simple Kotlin program that simulates vehicles passing through a checkpoint. Demonstrates basic Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

## 🎯 What I Learned
- Kotlin class syntax with constructors
- Using `init` blocks for initialization  
- String interpolation (`$variable`)
- Conditional statements and logic
- Basic program structure in Kotlin

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Copy the code from `VehicleCheckpoint.kt`
2. Paste into IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio
3. Run the `main()` function

## 📸 Sample Output
```
Tesla is a new and Tesla has 2 doors
Tesla is moving
Tesla has stopped at the checkpoint
your papers are up to date: 2022
The car is your: Owner Alex Hamilton
You are old enough to drive: 19
```

## 📁 Project Structure
```
VehicleCheckpoint.kt
├── Machine class
│   ├── Properties: name, model, year, doors
│   ├── Methods: move(), stop()
│   └── init block for validation
└── CheckPost class
    ├── Validates registration date
    ├── Checks driver age
    └── Verifies ownership
```

## 💡 Future Improvements
- [ ] Convert to Android app with UI
- [ ] Add more vehicle types
- [ ] Implement database storage
- [ ] Add unit tests

## 📚 About Me
I'm a 14-year-old learning Kotlin and Android development. This is my first real project!
